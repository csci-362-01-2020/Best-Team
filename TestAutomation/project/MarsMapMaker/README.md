Mars Map Maker
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello and welcome to Mars Map Maker. This is an app that is being created to work in tandem with MARS from CIRDLES to allow
entitites to properly register their rock samples with SESAR (System for Earth Sample Registration) to aquire their IGSN 
(International Geo Sample Number). It's general purpose is to allow the user to submit an example file that contains a portion 
of their own data and it's metadata and to interact with the user to output a javascript mapping file that allows a mapping 
between their metadata and SESAR's metadata. If you would like to demo Mars Map Maker in its current development to see its 
progress or to contribute follow the steps listed below.

How to Demo Mars Map Maker
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) clone this repository 
2) install npm (make sure to click the checkbox during the process that says automatically install the necessary tools....)
3) navigate to the cloned folder in your terminal/powershell (if using windows)
4) type "npm install" and allow for the installation to complete
5) type "npm start" and wait for the window to pop up in your browser
  (it defaults to port 3000, but if used will attempt to use 3001 and so on....)













Create React App info
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
